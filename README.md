# NYC-Taxi-Insights-Cloud-Powered-ETL-and-ML-driven-Fare-Predictions-on-GCP

## Objective

In this project, my objective was to design and implement an end-to-end data pipeline, encompassing the following stages:

1. Extracted 100k records from the 2016 TLC Website, loading them into Google Cloud Storage for initial processing.
2. Applied fact and dimensional data modeling techniques using Python on Jupyter Notebook to comprehensively transform and model the data.
3. Orchestrated the ETL pipeline on Mage AI, ensuring the seamless loading of transformed data into Google BigQuery.
4. Conducted in-depth analysis using BigQuery, uncovering key patterns translated into a user-friendly Looker Studio dashboard.
5. Implemented a precise taxi fare forecasting model using BQML, achieving an RMSE of 4.03 for accurate prediction.
